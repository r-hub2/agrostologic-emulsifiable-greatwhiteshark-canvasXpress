***canvasXpress*** was developed as the core visualization component for bioinformatics and systems biology analysis
at Bristol-Myers Squibb. It supports a large number of [visualizations ](https://www.canvasxpress.org/examples.html) to display scientific and non-scientific
data. ***canvasXpress*** also includes a simple and unobtrusive [user interface](https://www.canvasxpress.org/docs/interface.html) to explore complex data sets, a sophisticated and unique mechanism to keep track of all user customization for [Reproducible Research ](https://www.canvasxpress.org/docs/audit.html) purposes, as well as an 'out of the box'
broadcasting capability to synchronize selected data points in all ***canvasXpress*** plots in a page. Data can
be easily sorted, grouped, transposed, transformed or clustered dynamically. The fully customizable mouse events
as well as the zooming, panning and drag-and-drop capabilities are features that make this library unique in its
class.

***canvasXpress*** can be now simply used within R at the console to generate conventional plots, in R-Studio
or seamlessly embedded in [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co) web applications. Full-fledged examples of the ***canvasXpress*** library including the mouse events, zooming, and broadcasting capabilities are included in this package in several examples that can be accessed using the cxShinyExample function.  This ***canvasXpress*** R library was created with the [htmlwidgets](https://github.com/ramnathv/htmlwidgets) package.

### Installation

canvasXpress is available for installation from 
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=canvasXpress) or you can install the
latest version of ***canvasXpress*** from GitHub as follows:

```r
devtools::install_github('neuhausi/canvasXpress')
```

### Examples

These are included to get you started on basic charting - there are many more
examples (including complex and compound visualizations) with R code available 
in the Examples section of the main website at 
[https://www.canvasxpress.org](https://www.canvasxpress.org)

#### Scatter 3D Plot

### More Examples and Resources

In addition to the built-in package documentation there are vignettes with 
more information on getting started and additional examples:

```r
#List all package vignettes
vignette(package = "canvasXpress")

#View a specific vignette
vignette("getting_started", package = "canvasXpress")
vignette("additional_examples", package = "canvasXpress")
```

For the use of canvasXpress plots in shiny there are interactive examples available through the
package function *cxShinyExample*

```r
#List example names
cxShinyExample()

#Run an interactive shiny example
cxShinyExample(example = "example1")
```

There is also a wealth of additional information including full API documentation 
and extensive R and JavaScript examples at [https://www.canvasxpress.org](https://www.canvasxpress.org).
